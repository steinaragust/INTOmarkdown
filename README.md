## 1. Linux uppsetning

I did actually install linux a while ago, i mounted the image on usb,
booted through bios and resized the hardrive into two partitions.
It was really easy.

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

I think this is too much of a straightforward question as i only typed in
the two given commands into terminal and typed in my password twice and poof.

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

I really dont have any friends so i decided to do this alone, it went really
easy, i started by cloning the repository into my cpu and then edit it with
vim, to save and exit i did ":qw << enter", then i contributed the edit file
using the given command and accidently named t "My first git commit" and submitted
it.

Here is a link to my file:
